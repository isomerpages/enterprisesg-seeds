SEEDS Capital supports founders who are pushing the boundaries of scientific innovation and solving global challenges. Learn about our [co-investment model](/about-us/our-co-investment-model/) and our [our investees](/portfolio-companies/all-companies/).

If your startup is ready to fundraise from us and our co-investment partners, here are two steps:


##### **1. Check your eligibility:** <br><br>

* Singapore-based company with core activities carried out here.
* Incorporated as a Private Limited company for less than 10 years.
* Paid-up capital of at least $50,000.
* Prove substantial innovative and intellectual content for its products and/or services and applications
* High-growth potential with clear scalability for the international market.
* Have identified a ready, independent third-party investor(s).
* Business must not be involved in the following business activities: gambling, tobacco-related products, or any other activities which are in violation of law, or against public interest.
* Company cannot be a subsidiary or joint venture.


##### **2. Identify an institutional investor** 
SEEDS Capital works with 50 co-investment partners i.e., VC firms, that were selected based on their experience and track record in our focus sectors. Approach our partners [here](/for-startups/co-investment-partners/all-partners/).

If you have already identified an investor that is not listed as our appointed co-investment partners, contact us at [seeds@enterprisesg.gov.sg](mailto:seeds@enterprisesg.gov.sg) with the following documents:

**Background information of the co-investor**
* Ability to contribute to the startupâ€™s growth strategies
* Management experience, relevant business contacts and/or necessary technical expertise that can value-add to the startup
* Proposed investment quantum
* Demonstration of independence with no prior interest (i.e., not holding shares in the investee prior to the co-investment for new investments)

**Information of your startup**
* Two-page executive summary of the startup
* Supporting documents for a first-level assessment would include:
	* Business plan 
	* Financial statements or management accounts 
	* ACRA Bizfile

Our Investment Team will assess the investment opportunity and undertake due diligence accordingly. 

The final stage of assessment will be conducted by: 
* Our Investment Committee (for co-investments with our appointed partners) or 
* [Our Investment Panel](/about-us/investment-panel/) (for co-investments with non-appointed partners)

Companies that are not a fit with our investment mandate will be informed.
