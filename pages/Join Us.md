**Join us to grow deep tech startups in Singapore**


**What you can expect**

At SEEDS Capital, we hope to offer you a meaningful career as you support our mission to grow deep tech startups in Singapore.

**• Exposure to the startup and investor ecosystem**

You will be building relationships with founders and management team members of startups, venture investors, other investors and other stakeholders in the ecosystems. You will also be attending startups’ board meetings representing SEEDS Capital and help startups grow operations and connect them to the larger community.
Beyond Singapore, we also offer overseas exposure opportunities through overseas work trips or attachments to learn about overseas ecosystems and partners. 

We will also equip you with skillsets to engage stakeholders through training and development workshops, core competency modules and company visits as part of our ZoomStart orientation programme for all new hires.


**• Championing growth of the deep tech ecosystem in Singapore**

You will help us uncover promising deep tech Singapore startups and help to provide early-stage financing to super-charge their journey to find product-market fit or growth. 

Beyond equity financing, you will be able to direct startups to EnterpriseSG’s financial and non-financial initiatives to support their growth areas through non-equity financing, markets, and talent. 
As an EnterpriseSG Officer, you will interact with other colleagues from other divisions and participate in other organization or government-wide initiatives or efforts to develop the local tech startup ecosystem.


• **Building up your investment expertise in 
venture capital** 

You will hone your investment expertise and business acumen as you review pitch decks, financial projections and term sheets and put together an investment case. You will also work alongside venture capitalists to jointly evaluate, negotiate and close deals. After the investment, you will also support the portfolio companies and provide advice on their performance metrics and key decisions such as hiring and fundraising.

We will also discuss and spar intellectually over valuations, business models, and startups’ strategies as a team. We will train and equip you to understand venture capital financial and legal jargon.
