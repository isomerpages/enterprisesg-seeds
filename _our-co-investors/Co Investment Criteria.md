Through co-investments, we support the growth of innovative startups with strong intellectual content and global market potential.

If your startup is ready to raise capital and draw interest from [our co-investment partners](/our-co-investors/list-of-investors), here are 3 steps you can take to determine your eligibility :

#### **1. Check if your startup will fulfil the following criteria:** <br/><br/>
* A Singapore-based company with core activities carried out here
* Startup should not be a subsidiary or joint-venture
* Incorporated as a private limited company for less than ten years
* Paid-up capital of at least S$50,000

* Prove substantial innovative and intellectual content for its products and/or services and applications
* High-growth potential with clear scalability for the international market

#### **2. Identify one of SEEDS Capital's appointed co-investment partner(s) to work with** 
We prefer working and co-investing with our appointed partners as they are strategic, private sector investors that has been evaluated on multiple and stringent criteria. 

Startups that work with these appointed partners **increase the chances that we will see potential in your startup early on**, or quickly determine whether we are the right investor for you. Our list of appointed partners can be found [here](/our-co-investors/list-of-investors). 

#### **3. Contact our appointed co-investment partners directly**<br>
Companies should apply directly to our appointed partners to assess their investment case. Our appointed partners will submit the prospective co-investment to SEEDS Capital for further evaluation.

#### **4. Request your co-investment partner to submit an application to us if you prefer working with a non-appointed partner**
