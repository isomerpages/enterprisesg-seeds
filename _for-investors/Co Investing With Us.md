SEEDS Capital’s mandate is to stimulate private sector investments into Singapore-based deep tech startups. 

We value partners who can:
* Identify and co-invest in Singapore-based, deep tech and early-stage startups in the Advanced Manufacturing & Engineering, Agrifood Tech, Health & Biomedical Sciences and Urban Solutions sectors and
* Contribute to the startups' growth strategies.

There are two ways to co-invest with us: 

##### **1. Apply to be a co-investment partner**

We will publicly release information on the next call for new co-investment partner applications. We do not have an open call now.

Co-investment applicants will be evaluated against a robust set of criteria.

Applicants will be assessed based on their alignment to the Startup SG Equity co-investment scheme objectives and their ability to value-add to startups. This would include: 
* Ability to contribute to the startup’s growth strategies 
* Management experience, relevant business contacts and/or technical expertise that can value-add to the startup. 
* Access to good deal flow and availability of investment funds for immediate deployment.  
* Investment decision making, governance and fund management process

##### **2. Approach us for ad-hoc co-investments**

If you are a non-appointed partner and keen to co-invest with us, contact us at [seeds@enterprisesg.gov.sg](mailto:seeds@enterprisesg.gov.sg) with the following documents. Our [Investment Panel](/about-us/investment-panel/) will assess these investment opportunities:

**Information of the co-investor**
* Ability to contribute to the startup’s growth strategies
* Management experience, relevant business contacts and/or necessary technical expertise that can value-add to the startup
* Proposed investment quantum
* Demonstrate independence with no prior interest (e.g., not hold shares in the investee prior to the co-investment for new investments)

**Information of the startup**
* A two-page executive summary of your startup
* Supporting documents for a first-level assessment would include:
	* Business plan of your startup
	* Financial statements or management accounts of your startup
	* Business ACRA of your startup
