SEEDS Capital’s core mandate is to stimulate private sector investments into deep tech startups (as described in [About Us / Overview](/about-us/overview)).

We value partners who can:
* Identify and co-invest in Singapore-based, deep tech and early-stage startups in the Advanced Manufacturing & Engineering, Agrifood Tech, Health & Biomedical Sciences and Urban Solutions sectors;
* Enable early-stage startups to fast-track commercialisation through mentorship and business matching.

There are two ways to co-invest with us: 

##### **1. Apply to be a co-investment partner**

We will publicly release information on the next call for new co-investment partner applications. We do not have an open call now. You can sign up for our newsletter [here](https://enterprisesg.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b5fb15f5d3fd9e98d46329c56&id=d848098406) to stay abreast of our activities. 

Co-investment applicants will be evaluated against a robust set of criteria.

* **Access to Funding and Expertise:** The investor should have funds ready for immediate deployment and connections to other investors, innovators and business leaders who can value-add to startups. 
* **Decision Making & Fund Management Process:** The investor should have a robust due diligence process with supplementary checks and balances to prevent any conflict of interest. The investment committee should contain at least one independent member who is separate from the main deal sourcing team.

**We also look for the following traits:**
* Capability of the management team
* Access to commercialisation resources
* Developmental and economic contributions to Singapore 
* Access to good deal flow in Singapore

##### **2. Approach us for ad-hoc co-investments**

**Background information of the co-investor**
* Ability to contribute to the startup’s growth strategies
* Management experience, relevant business contacts and/or necessary technical expertise that can value-add to the startup
* Proposed investment quantum
* Demonstrate independence with no prior interest (e.g., not hold shares in the investee prior to the co-investment for new investments)

**Background information of the startup**
* A two-page executive summary of your startup
* Supporting documents for a first-level assessment would include:
	* Business plan of your startup
	* Financial statements or management accounts of your startup
	* Business ACRA of your startup
