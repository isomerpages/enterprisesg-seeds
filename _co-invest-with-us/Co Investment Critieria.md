One of SEEDS Capital's objective is to encourage more private sector investments in nascent sectors.

We work towards this objective by co-investing with institutional investors in the private sector to help de-risk their investments.   

To achieve this objective, we are stringent on the co-investors that we would like to work with. This includes your alignment to the Startup SG Equity co-investment scheme objectives and the ability to value-add to startups.

If you are an institutional investor looking for a co-investor, there are two ways to partner with us:

#### (i) To be appointed as a co-investment partner

We prefer working and co-investing with our appointed partners as they are strategic, private sector investors that has been evaluated on multiple and stringent criteria. 

Deals done with our appointed partners have a higher chance of passing our investment panel and form a majority of the deals that we have made to date. 

We will publicly release information on the next call for new co-investment partner applications. You will be evaluated on multiple criteria, including a strong management team, experience or track record in the relevant domains and ability to value-add to startups in specific emerging industry(s).
