##### **Enabling the growth of deep tech startups through co-investments**

Globally, the application of deep technology has tackled previously challenging problems and showcased its immense transformative potential to better human society.

In the last ten years, Singapore’s startup ecosystem has evolved tremendously. While the ecosystem has been largely successful in supporting and financing tech startups, deep tech startups are underserved by most VCs / PEs due to their long gestation periods, high-risk profiles and need for in-house expertise. 

Our co-investment schemes are designed to provide leverage to our co-investors, thereby driving investments into deep tech sectors and enabling deep tech startup growth. 

##### **Fund Manager of StartupSG Equity**

SEEDS Capital is one of the appointed fund managers for the [Startup SG Equity (SSGE) scheme](https://www.startupsg.gov.sg/programmes/4895/startup-sg-equity). The SSGE scheme is part of Singapore’s national R&D blueprint that spans [Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE)](https://www.nrf.gov.sg/rie2025-plan). 

Our investment parameters are as such:


|  | **General tech**  | **Deep tech*** |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Investment cap for each startup**     | S$2M from SEEDS Capital    | S$8M from SEEDS Capital     |
| **Co-investment ratio (SEEDS Capital: co-investor)** | 7:3 up to the first S$250K from SEEDS Capital; 1:1 thereafter, up to S$2M   | 7:3 up to the first S$500K from SEEDS Capital; 1:1 thereafter, up to S$4M; 3:7 thereafter, up to S$8M    |
