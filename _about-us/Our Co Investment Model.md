##### **Enabling the growth of deep tech startups through co-investments**

Deep-tech startups possess unique and innovative solutions with the potential to transform industries and solve the most challenging problems we face today.    

However, these technologies tend to be underinvested. Investments into deep-tech startups are generally perceived as risky as these frontier technologies have longer gestation period.

Our co-investment scheme is designed to address these risks by providing support to our co-investors, thereby encouraging more private sector investments into these nascent areas, and enabling the growth of deep tech in Singapore.
