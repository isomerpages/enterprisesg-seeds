##### Investment arm of Enterprise Singapore, nurturing Singapore-based tech startups with intellectual property and global market potential

SEEDS Capital was founded in 2001 when its first co-investment fund was launched to foster entrepreneurship.

Leveraging Enterprise Singapore’s extensive networks across more than 15 sectors and 30+ global overseas centers, we support our portfolio companies to scale strategically and internationalise. 

In recent years, we have deployed more than S$130M and stimulated more than S$1B of private sector investments into >350 companies. Learn more about our co-investment partners and the startups here.


##### Enabling the growth of deep tech startups through co-investments 
Globally, the application of deep technology has tackled previously challenging problems and showcased its immense transformative potential to better human society.

In the last ten years, Singapore’s startup ecosystem has evolved tremendously. While the ecosystem has been largely successful in supporting and financing tech startups, deep tech startups are underserved by most VCs / PEs due to their long gestation periods, high-risk profiles and need for in-house expertise. 

Our co-investment schemes are designed to provide leverage to our co-investors, thereby driving investments into deep tech sectors and enabling deep tech startup growth.  

##### Fund Manager of StartupSG Equity 
SEEDS Capital is one of the appointed fund managers for the Startup SG Equity (SSGE) scheme. The SSGE scheme is part of Singapore’s national R&D blueprint that spans Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE).
