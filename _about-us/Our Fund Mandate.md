As the investment arm of Enterprise Singapore and as one of the entities appointed to manage funds under Startup SG Equity, SEEDS Capital seeks to catalyse smart monies into Singapore-based, early-stage technology startups. 

**Our Investment Model**\
We co-invest with strategic, private sector investors. Our partner investors are institutional investors such as venture capital firms and investment arms of corporates.

**Our Investment Focus**\
We invest in early stage, Singapore-based startups. They are innovative startups with strong intellectual content and have the potential to scale globally. 

We focus on startups in nascent and strategic industries with future potential such as Advanced Manufacturing & Engineering (AME), Health & Biomedical Sciences (HBMS), and Urban Solutions & Sustainability (USS). We also look at other emerging technologies such as Agri-tech, Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Quantum Computing and Space Technologies. 

**Investment Caps and Ratios**\
We co-invest in startups with the following criteria:


|  | **General tech**  | **Deep tech** |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Investment cap for each startup**     | S$2M from SEEDS Capital    | S$8M from SEEDS Capital     |
| **Co-investment ratio (SEEDS Capital: co-investor)** | 7:3 up to the first S$250K from SEEDS Capital; 1:1 thereafter, up to S$2M   | 7:3 up to the first S$500K from SEEDS Capital; 1:1 thereafter, up to S$4M; 3:7 thereafter, up to S$8M    |

**Our co-investment approaches**\
We co-invest through two approaches:
- With appointed co-investment partners
- With other non-appointed co-investors into startups
