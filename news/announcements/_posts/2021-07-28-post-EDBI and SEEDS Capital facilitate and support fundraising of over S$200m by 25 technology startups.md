EDBI, the dedicated investment arm of Economic Development Board, and SEEDS Capital, the investment arm of Enterprise Singapore, have jointly facilitated and supported fundraising of S$216 million by 25 promising technology startups based in Singapore to date, through the Special Situation Fund for Startups (SSFS). Over half of the total funds raised came from private investors. The SSFS investment scheme was introduced in June last year to catalyse investments into high-potential startups to help them sustain their growth momentum, as startups doing well pre-COVID-19 may face cash flow or fundraising difficulties in a more challenging financing climate.

The 25 startups span sectors such as e-commerce, edtech, enterprise technology, fintech, healthcare and tourism, and account for over 1,200 jobs. These include roles related to software engineering, product development and data science. The investments are expected to boost market expansion and product development plans for these startups over the next three years.
