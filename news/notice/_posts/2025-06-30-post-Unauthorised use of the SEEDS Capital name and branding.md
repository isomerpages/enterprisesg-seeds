<p>We are aware of ongoing unauthorised activities involving the misuse of
the SEEDS Capital name, branding and reputation by a group operating primarily
in China.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These activities may be taking place on chat platforms or websites to
promote events and community membership recruitment with financial incentive
schemes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These activities are in no way affiliated with SEEDS Capital, Enterprise
Singapore (EnterpriseSG), Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) or
SG Growth Capital. SEEDS Capital does not operate in China and SEEDS Capital
officers will never offer financial incentives for participation in our
programmes.</p>
