<p>We are aware of ongoing unauthorised activities involving the misuse of
the SEEDS name, branding and reputation by a group operating primarily
in China.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These activities may be taking place on chat platforms or websites to
promote events and community membership recruitment with financial incentive
schemes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These activities are in no way affiliated with SEEDS, Enterprise Singapore
(EnterpriseSG), the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) or SG Growth
Capital. SEEDS does not operate in China and SEEDS officers will never
offer financial incentives for participation in our programmes.</p>

<p>If you have been contacted or come across suspicious materials bearing
our name or logo, we encourage you to exercise caution and report the incident
to us at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">infohq@sggc.sg</a>.</p>
