<p>Singapore, Tuesday, 4 February 2025</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SEEDS Capital (SEEDS), the investment arm of
Enterprise Singapore (EnterpriseSG), has appointed 20 new local and global
partners to co-invest in innovative Singapore-based deep tech startups.
Under the Startup SG Equity scheme<sup>[1]</sup>, SEEDS will set aside
S$150 million over the next three years, to catalyse another S$300 million
through its private sector partners, in areas including Advanced Manufacturing,
Pharmbio / Medtech, Agrifood Tech, Sustainability (such as Energy, Circular
Economy, Urban Mobility, Water), Spacetech and Quantumtech.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the new appointments, SEEDS now has a
pool of 52 co-investors with strong technical and domain expertise, commercial
knowledge, international networks, early-growth investment capabilities,
and the ability to lead funding rounds, which will help startups scale
successfully.</p>
<p><strong>Enabling startups’ overseas ambitions through global networks</strong>
</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New partners like East Ventures (Indonesia),
Global Brain (Japan), HIVEN (South Korea), Paspalis Capital (Australia)
and Valuence Ventures (USA / South Korea) provide resources and global
networks to support startups in exploring and entering new markets, for
customer acquisition or diversifying supply chains. For instance, Paspalis’
strong presence in Australia’s Northern Territory has provided SEEDS’ Spacetech
investees like Equatorial Space Systems with opportunities to test-bed
their solutions; East Ventures’ extensive networks in Indonesia has helped
SEEDS’ investee Mesh Bio secure its first Indonesian customer and has also
supported AMILI to expand its operations into Indonesia.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Expanding overseas, especially into Japan,
presents challenges such as cultural differences, communication barriers,
and navigating high-context corporate environments. Many Singapore startups
find it difficult to adapt to Japan’s intricate decision-making processes
and indirect communication styles. We actively support our portfolio companies
by helping them localize their strategies and refine their value propositions
for the Japanese market. Additionally, we guide them in building relationships
and fitting their solutions into the larger strategic goals of Japanese
corporates. This hands-on support ensures smoother market entry and fosters
long-term partnerships,” said Mr. Tatsuya Matsumoto, Partner, Global Brain,</p>
<p><strong>Driving growth through technical expertise</strong>
</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new appointments also include local investors
familiar with Singapore’s operating landscape, who can advise and mentor
startups in areas like regulation and scaling. These funds can amplify
their deployment in Singapore, contributing to the local capital pool and
ecosystem development. Some of these include Vickers Venture Partners,
iGlobe Partners, K3 Ventures, Antares Ventures, Monk’s Hill Ventures and
Tin Men Capital.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Despite the relative nascency of Singapore's
deep tech landscape compared to more mature startup ecosystems, we feel
that the deep tech ecosystem here is reaching a critical point, thanks
largely to the numerous government initiatives. While we have made selective
deep tech investments in the past, we are extremely excited about our current
pipeline, which includes a significantly higher proportion of deep tech
startups, with founders targeting diverse areas such as material science
in agri-tech, advanced robotics, artificial intelligence for healthcare
diagnostics, and next-generation semiconductor technologies across Southeast
Asia.,” said Mr Arun Pai, Principal, Monk’s Hill Ventures.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deep tech startups in particular require more
support, as they often face long technology and product development periods
and require substantial capital investment, especially at the growth stage,
for production lines, industrial scaling, or clinical trials. New partner
funds like healthcare VCs Kurma Partners, 22Health Ventures and Trinity
Innovation Biosciences Singapore; sustainability VCs Eurazeo and Shift4Good;
as well as hard tech VCs Xora, Matter Venture Partners and ST Engineering
Ventures are equipped with industry and technical expertise to better guide
and support the development of these technologies.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Said Mr. Julien Mialaret, Operating Partner,
and Mr. Ernest Xue, Director, Eurazeo, “In 2025, we expect [investment]
activity to accelerate further due to the maturity of key technologies
and their increasing economic viability, driving broader adoption. Additionally,
concerted efforts in Europe and Asia to support green technologies and
low-carbon economies will further fuel investment momentum. Our focus will
remain on helping founders scale solutions effectively across target markets.”</p>
<p>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Said Ms Cindy Khoo, Chairman of SEEDS Capital,
“We are happy to see strong interest from the venture capital community,
ranging from established Singapore-based funds to international funds with
deep expertise and experience backing deep tech category leaders, as well
as corporate venture funds looking to back promising startups here with
synergistic technologies and business models. SEEDS is committed to growing
Singapore’s startup ecosystem and will double down on efforts to nurture
a strong core of deep tech startups. We are excited to work closely with
our new co-investment partners to further develop and scale the next generation
of innovative, impactful technologies."</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; To date, close to S$3 billion has been invested in over 330
startups under the Startup SG Equity scheme. To better support the development
of early to early-growth stage deep tech startups, SEEDS had also raised
its co-investment cap from S$8 million to S$12 million for each deep tech
startup. The list of SEEDS’ newly appointed partners can be found in Annex
A. For more details, please visit <strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.seedscapital.sg/for-startups/co-investment-partners/all-partners/</a>.</strong>
