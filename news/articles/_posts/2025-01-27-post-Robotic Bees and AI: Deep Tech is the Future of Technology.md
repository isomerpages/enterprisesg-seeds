<p>Imagine a world where science has advanced to the point where all known
illnesses have met their match, quantum computing is commonplace and used
to solve complex problems in minutes. Where environmental pollution is
a receding issue of the past and entire cities, even countries, are running
on clean, renewable energy.</p>
<p>These are not mere fantasies, but glimpses of the future that deep tech
startups are working to bring to reality. Deep tech startups in Singapore
are not just inventing the latest gadgets or the next big app, they aspire
to solve critical issues faced globally. Whether it’s sustainability or
global health, energy or food security, deep tech is harnessing and developing
cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), biotechnology,
quantum computing, and more to address some of the most pressing challenges
faced by humanity and the planet.</p>
<p><strong>A measured warming of a frigid fundraising environment</strong>

<p>The promises of deep tech are undeniable, but the past few years have
impacted the venture capital landscape and slowed down progress in deep
tech innovation. On the bright side, the 9-month Singapore Venture Funding
Landscape 2024 study by Enterprise Singapore (EnterpriseSG) and PitchBook,
revealed deal volume steadily rebounding. However, transaction count decreased
by 10% to 369 and deal value falling slightly by 0.07% to S$4 billion during
the same period.<a href="https://www.startupsg.gov.sg/public/inline-images/EntSG_9M_2024_Venture%20Funding_Landscape_v1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>One of the factors behind this decline is the reversion to a “steady state
value”, where surpluses of capital from 2020 to 2021 created inflated valuations
among growth startups. Growth-stage companies are now returning to nominal
levels, and the shift towards lower valuations and the importance of impactful
products and services over hype will be increasingly important for raising
co-investment capital.</p>
<p>Another factor is the difficulty faced by deep tech startups in attracting
and retaining talent. These startups often require highly skilled employees
with years of experience in various fields to develop complex technologies.
However, they are scarce and in high demand due to insufficient talent
pools, especially in the face of competition from big tech firms and businesses
in other sectors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, deep tech startups continue to face an uncertain economic
outlook as they grapple with the aftermath of a global pandemic and various
macroeconomic factors that present downward pressure across industries
and markets. Increased requirements from regulatory hurdles, rising interest
rates, supply chain issues, and geopolitical tensions exacerbate the road
to growth and profitability.</p>

<p>Despite these headwinds, Singapore’s deep tech startups have put their
resilience and adaptability on display, emerging as a top draw for venture
capital investment. It was the largest venture capital market in Southeast
Asia through 2024, with local venture-backed firms accounting for more
than half (58%) of the region’s total deal volume.<a href="https://www.startupsg.gov.sg/public/inline-images/EntSG_9M_2024_Venture%20Funding_Landscape_v1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[2]</sup></a> This
reflects investors’ confidence and interest in the potential and value
of deep tech startups in Singapore, particularly in early-stage companies
operating in AI, biotech, and climate technology, prioritised both for
their long-term agendas and resilience during periods of lower seed funding
activity. Now, more than ever, deep tech startups depend on substantial
funding to progress through their often longer development stages and avoid
the risk of insolvency.</p>
<p><strong>Deep tech or just another startup</strong>
</p>
<p>Unlike many technology startups that concentrate on software and internet-based
solutions, deep tech startupsoften operate based on the convergence of
technologies. In fact, around 96% of deep tech ventures use at least two
technologies, with approximately 70% owning patents to their technology.
<a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2021/deep-tech-innovation" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[3]</sup>
</a>These new products bring about radical changes in how things work and
how we live – bringing forth entirely new paradigms rather than minor incremental
improvements.</p>
<p>Take homegrown agritech startup, Polybee for example. The company’s approach
to agriculture is advancing precision farming in leaps and bounds. Their
“robot bees” employ a novel Aerodynamically Controlled Pollination method
for contactless pollination. By integrating AI, computer vision, and drones,
Polybee can automate their pollination processes and refine produce yield
estimations simultaneously. Higher accuracy in yield predictions – up to
a week ahead, helps growers make better-informed decisions when pricing
their harvests. Most importantly, Polybee’s automated robotic worker drones
take the load off repetitive and labour-intensive tasks to not only boost
efficiency and crop health but also contribute to a more sustainable agricultural
practice.</p>
<p>While groundbreaking, this technological convergence may yield many complications
along the path towards success. Rigorous development and validation processes
often involve significantly more resources for scientific research, experimentation,
and testing as compared to the average tech startup. Deep tech startups
typically have longer gestation periods and require patient investor capital
as they need to overcome technical and market uncertainties before achieving
product-market fit and scale.</p>
<p>Deep tech startups also have high levels of sophistication in their innovations
and technologies, which are often novel and difficult to replicate. This
gives them a competitive edge, strong intellectual property protection,
as well as the potential to create new trickle-down markets by solving
previously unsolvable challenges. However, deep tech is also often difficult
to explain and quantify to potential investors, customers, and partners
– adding an extra layer of complexity to clinching funding. Deep tech startups
may have to educate and convince their stakeholders about the feasibility
and desirability of their solutions while effectively demonstrating their
traction and impact.</p>
<p>Although more difficult to cultivate, deep tech startups have the potential
to drive outsized impact in Singapore and across the world, particularly
in critical areas like healthcare. Companies like Kyan Therapeutics, Qritive,
and Pathnova exemplify this potential through their various approaches
to cancer care. Kyan Therapeutics’ Optim.AI™ system is redefining personalised
oncology treatment plans with its small data AI, efficiently identifying
precise drug-dose and therapy combinations for patients. Meanwhile, Qritive
continues to explore the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnoses with
its AI-powered pathology tools, crucial for timely and effective treatment.
Other startups like Pathnova are working on refining screening technology
and procedures for increasingly accurate and early cancer diagnosis. Collectively,
these deep tech ventures are not just improving existing methods but are
also creating innovative solutions that would benefit our society.</p>
<p><strong>Generating social surpluses with deep tech</strong>
</p>
<p>The economist William Nordhaus hypothesises that only 2% of the economic
value created by technology goes to the creators. The rest, 98%, goes to
the society as social surplus<a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w10433" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. This value
may not necessarily be captured in market prices.<a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w10433" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[5]</sup></a> For example,
the trickle-down benefits from healthcare innovations and improved healthcare
systems are substantial and impossible to fully quantify. Value could be
derived from the improved well-being of individuals who may enjoy longer
and healthier lives, the healthcare workers who can deliver better and
faster care to their patients, and the establishment of more resilient
and comprehensive healthcare systems globally. Deep tech makes a strong
case for pursuit as a worthy challenge across all industries and sectors,
potentially benefiting every level of society, be it from a socioeconomic
standpoint or the individual to entire communities for generations to come.</p>
<p>As the world continues to face unprecedented difficulties and opportunities,
deep tech startups will play a vital role in shaping the future of the
planet, driving high-technology clusters and activities, boosting competitiveness,
and attracting multinational corporations for productive joint R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Backed by world-class research institutes, universities, corporates and
startups, Singapore’s tech ecosystem is rich in talent, expertise, and
resources. Through strategic co-investments, Singapore has sustained its
private and public sector deep tech growth, overcoming Asia-Pacific’s recent
funding challenges with robust intellectual innovation and global aspirations.
Singapore has a clear path to becoming a global leader and partner in deep
tech, and it’s time to collectively seize this opportunity and become changemakers
for the world.</p>
<p><strong>Despite headwinds, deep tech continues to grow</strong>
</p>
<p>Deep tech has the potential to serve as the backbone of our world’s solutions,
with startups and their founders acting as the driving force – the dynamic
muscles propelling these solutions towards addressing humanity’s greatest
challenges.</p>
<p>Although fewer investments are penetrating the market, this selectivity
will push investors towards higher-quality opportunities. During periods
of economic, social and environmental adversity, the significance of innovation
and the role of changemakers become even more vital than ever before.</p>
<p>With the right resources, environment, and opportunities to grow and scale
their innovations, high-growth deep tech startups will continue to develop
new industries and nurture future innovative breakthroughs that may very
well change the world.</p>
