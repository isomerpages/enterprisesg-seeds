Which investors are the most active in Singapore? 

Using our data, we’ve generated this constantly updated list of investors that have poured money into Singapore-based startups in the past two years. We’ve arranged the firms by the number of deals they’ve done. We understand, however, that this tends to favor earlystage investors over others, so we’re working to produce content that better conveys the impact of each firm. 

To keep things concise, we’re only featuring firms that have invested in three or more companies in Singapore within the past two years. 

The “# of startups invested” under each firm is also limited to the region and that time frame. 

Our data is a work in progress. If you find that there’s inaccurate or missing information about your fund, please drop us a note at research@techinasia.com and we’ll be happy to assist.
