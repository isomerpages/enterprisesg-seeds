[MiyaHealth](https://miyahealth.com/), a Singapore-based healthtech firm, has raised an undisclosed amount in additional funding from HealthXCapital, Central Capital Ventura, and Seeds Capital. The round follows the startup’s [US$4.8 million pre-series A raise](https://www.techinasia.com/singaporebased-healthtech-firm-65m-booster) in February.

Founded in 2019 by [Ramesh Rajentheran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramesh-rajentheran-723248/), [Bevan Cheong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bevan-cheong/), and [Shirley Ah Hee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shirley-ah-hee/), the company currently offers two AI-powered services: [MiyaPayor](https://miyahealth.com/product/miya-payor/), a platform that helps reduce healthcare costs by using smart claim processing and predictive analytics; and [MiyaPatient](https://miyahealth.com/product/miya-patient/), a navigation tool that aids patients with chronic diseases to cope with their daily challenges.

MiyaHealth is also working on a new product called [MiyaProvider](https://miyahealth.com/product/miya-provider/) that aims to improve patients’ experience in hospitals and clinics. To date, the firm has partnered with over 3,000 medical service providers and 12,000 physicians.

The startup will use the new funds for product development, talent acquisition, and business expansion, looking to widen its reach in Southeast Asia and Europe. The company also said it is eyeing a series A round in the next six months.
